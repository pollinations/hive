# AI-Powered App Development Repository
Welcome to our innovative repository where AI meets application development! This is a unique project that leverages 100% AI-generated code to create and maintain various applications. Each folder in this repository contains a self-contained application, making it easy to understand and manage.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **100% AI-Generated Code**: All applications in this repository are created entirely through AI assistance
- **Self-Contained Apps**: Each folder represents an independent application
- **GitHub-Issue Driven Development**: New features and modifications are implemented through GitHub issues
- **AI Assistant Integration**: Powered by OpenHands coding assistant
- **Interactive Development**: Continuous refinement through comments and feedback

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Creating New Features or Apps**
   - Open a new GitHub issue describing your desired feature or application
   - The OpenHands coding assistant will automatically start implementing your request
   - Monitor progress through GitHub Actions

2. **Refining Implementation**
   - Comment on the issue to provide feedback or request changes
   - Trigger @MentatBot in your comments to continue the development process
   - The AI assistant will refine the implementation based on your feedback

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each folder in this repository represents a standalone application:
```
repository/
├── app1/          # Self-contained application 1
├── app2/          # Self-contained application 2
└── ...            # Additional applications
```

## 🤖 Using the AI Assistant

1. **To Create a New App**
   - Create a new issue with a detailed description of the desired application
   - Tag @MentatBot to initiate development
   - Follow the progress in GitHub Actions

2. **To Modify Existing Apps**
   - Open an issue describing the desired changes
   - Reference the specific application you want to modify
   - The AI assistant will implement the requested changes

3. **To Refine Implementation**
   - Comment on the existing issue
   - Provide specific feedback or requirements
   - The AI assistant will adjust the implementation accordingly

## 🔧 Development Process

1. **Issue Creation**
   - Describe your requirements clearly
   - Include any specific technologies or frameworks if needed
   - Add relevant labels to categorize the request

2. **AI Implementation**
   - OpenHands assistant analyzes the request
   - Generates appropriate code and structure
   - Creates necessary files and configurations

3. **Refinement**
   - Review the implementation
   - Provide feedback through comments
   - AI assistant makes requested adjustments

4. **Completion**
   - Final review and testing
   - Merge of changes
   - Issue closure
