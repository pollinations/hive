# 🐝 Pollinations Hive

Welcome to Pollinations Hive - a revolutionary repository where AI meets collaborative development! This project showcases a unique approach to software development where applications are created and modified entirely through AI assistance.

## 🌟 Overview

Pollinations Hive is a collection of self-contained applications, each residing in its own folder. What makes this repository special is its development approach: **100% of the code is AI-generated**, created through collaboration between humans and AI assistants.

## 🤖 How It Works

1. **Issue-Driven Development**: All new features and modifications start with a GitHub issue
2. **AI Assistance**: Our AI coding assistant (@MentatBot) implements the requested features
3. **Interactive Refinement**: Developers can comment on issues to guide and refine the implementation
4. **Continuous Evolution**: The codebase grows and improves through this AI-human collaboration

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each folder in this repository contains a self-contained application. This modular structure ensures:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy navigation
- Independent functionality
- Simplified maintenance

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Creating or Modifying an App

1. **Create an Issue**
   - Open a new GitHub issue
   - Clearly describe the feature or modification you want
   - Be specific about requirements and expectations

2. **Trigger the AI Assistant**
   - Mention @MentatBot in your issue
   - The bot will analyze your request and start implementing

3. **Refine Through Comments**
   - Review the AI's implementation
   - Provide feedback through comments
   - The AI will adjust based on your input

### Using @MentatBot

To engage with our AI assistant:
- Use `@mentatbot` in your issues or comments
- Be clear and specific in your requests
- The bot will respond with a plan and begin implementation
- You can continue the conversation through comments
