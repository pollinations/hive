## üìö Documentation

### üîç Pull Request Previews

Every pull request in this repository gets an automatic preview deployment. Here's how it works:

#### Triggers
- Preview deployments are created when a PR is opened, synchronized, or reopened
- The deployment workflow runs when changes are made to:
  - Any `package.json` file
  - Any `index.html` file
  - Any files within app directories

#### What Gets Deployed
- Each app in the repository is built and deployed
- For Node.js apps (with package.json):
  - The app is built using `npm run build`
  - Build output from `build/` or `dist/` is deployed
- For static sites (with index.html):
  - Files are copied directly to the preview

#### Accessing Previews
- Each PR gets a dedicated preview URL
- The GitHub Actions bot comments on the PR with preview links
- Preview URL format: `https://pollinations.github.io/hive/pr-{PR_NUMBER}/`
- Each preview includes an index page that lists all apps available in that preview
- You can find active PR previews by:
  1. Looking at open pull requests in the repository
  2. Finding the GitHub Actions bot comment with the preview link
  3. Visiting the index page at `https://pollinations.github.io/hive/pr-{PR_NUMBER}/`
