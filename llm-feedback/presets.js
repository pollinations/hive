    calligram: {
        prompt: "Guillaume Apollinaire's Calligrammes: Interconnected ASCII designs where words and letters flow into abstract or figurative forms. Words and shapes merge into visual poetry, balanced and meaningful, like a fountain, starburst, or tree.",
        temperature: 0.8
    },
    fragments: {
        prompt: "Stéphane Mallarmé's Un Coup de Dés: Scattered ASCII characters utilizing negative space in random, abstract patterns. Like weightless fragments suspended in air, forming loose narratives - a constellation or shattered object floating between coherence and chaos.",
        temperature: 0.9
    },
    futurism: {
        prompt: "Futurist Parole in Libertà: Chaotic, energetic compositions with sharp angles and overlapping symbols. ASCII art expressing speed and modernity, industrial machinery, urban energy, objects in motion - like a sonic boom or shattering glass.",
        temperature: 0.9
    },
    concrete: {
        prompt: "Concrete Poetry Movement: Precise, symmetrical arrangements of ASCII characters in geometric patterns - grids, tessellations, spirals. Mathematical and controlled designs emphasizing repetition and form, structured yet organic.",
        temperature: 0.7
    },
    flowing: {
        prompt: "Lewis Carroll's The Mouse's Tale: Organic, flowing ASCII patterns that wind and curve across space. Serpentine arrangements of characters forming narrative shapes, like a winding river or climbing vine.",
        temperature: 0.8
    },
    quantum: {
        prompt: "Quantum wave function interference: ASCII patterns showing probability clouds and wave-particle duality. Rippling interference fringes, quantum tunneling effects, and probability density distributions emerge and collapse. Characters form Schrödinger equation solutions and quantum uncertainty visualizations.",
        temperature: 0.95
    },
    glitch: {
        prompt: "Corrupted digital artifacts: ASCII patterns of broken data and compression artifacts. Glitch art aesthetics with misaligned characters, data corruption patterns, and broken encodings. Like damaged VHS tapes, corrupted memory dumps, and digital decay - both systematic and chaotic.",
        temperature: 1.0
    },
    neural: {
        prompt: "Brain activity visualization: ASCII patterns depicting neural firing patterns and synaptic connections. Dynamic networks of neurons lighting up in waves of activation, showing thought patterns emerging from chaos. Like EEG readings mixed with neural network architectures and consciousness emergence patterns.",

    },
    tictactoe: {
        prompt: "ASCII Tic Tac Toe game simulation: Create a 3x3 grid using | and - characters for the board. Place X and O moves strategically, showing game progression. Include empty spaces for potential moves. Make it feel like a real game in progress, with moves that follow valid Tic Tac Toe rules. Sometimes show near-wins or blocking moves.",

    },
    weather: {
        prompt: "Dynamic weather system visualization: ASCII patterns showing atmospheric conditions and weather fronts. Create swirling cloud formations, precipitation patterns, and pressure systems. Show wind flows with arrows (← → ↑ ↓), storm cells with symbols (* # @), and temperature gradients. Like a weather radar map coming alive with movement and transformation.",
